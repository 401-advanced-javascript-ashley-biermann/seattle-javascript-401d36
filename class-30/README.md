# Module 5: DS&A / Recap

Recap module 5 concepts and dive into DS&A by implementing a new Data Structure

## Learning Objectives

- Career coaching regarding the behavioral interview.
- Discussion and demonstration of Hashing data structures.

### Students will be able to

- Approach the behavioral interview with confidence and preparedness.
- Understand and implement a hashmap / hashtable in order to understand the abstraction and solutions the structure provides.

#### Describe and Define

- Data Structure Implementation -  <!-- To Be Completed By Instructor -->

```js

/**
 * The hashmap contains 4 main methods
 *   add - puts a new key value pair into the structure
 *   find - returns the value that added to the hash structure
 *   getHash - creates an integer that represent the hash of a given key
 *   contains - returns a boolean representing whether or not the structure a value for a given key.
**/

class HashMap {
  constructor(size) {
    this.size = size;
    this.buckets = new Array(size);
  }

  add(key, value) {

  }

  find(key) {

  }

  getHash(key) {

  }

  contains(key) {

  }
}

```
