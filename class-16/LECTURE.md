# Class 16

## Recap of modukes
  week 1: Node Calisthentics.
  week 2: Built an express server, is a RESTful
  week 3: Authentication system that sits in our Express Server.
  week 4: Event Driven Programming -> distributed system architecture.

## Midterms are here!
  - Think about some ideas that work well as a REST API.
    - Needs some sort of Auth.
    - Don't spend tons of time on a UI.  You're only graded on the API itself.
  -  Project Examples:
     -  Integration into a already supported platform.
        -  Slack bot, slack automation / Discord.
        -  Spotify integration.
     -  Saving something to cloud storage ( music, images, CMS style content )
     -  Manages config files ( JSON / markdown ).
     -  Integrating other Cloud APIs ( Pokeapi, Geolocation Data ).

## Warm Up

- Writing a function that can take in a Binary Tree, and returns the total number of leaves in that tree?
  - Leaf: Node in a tree that has 0 children.
  - Focus on Algorithm :)
